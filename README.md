TwitterWaterflow
================

famous Twitter Waterflow problem in Haskell

## Remarks

I had a look at the problem, took pen and pencil, chewed a bit on it and wrote it down as it came to mind.

Of course there are better, faster, more abstract, shorter, etc. solutions out there.

After crawling the web I found this [beatiful blog post](http://chrisdone.com/posts/twitter-problem-loeb) from Chris Done - have a look at it for maximum awesomeness ;)
